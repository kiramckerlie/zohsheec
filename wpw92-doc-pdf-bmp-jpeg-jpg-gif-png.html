                            <p>When I check in tools.pingdom there are 2 redirects and they're slowing down the site - why is this happening? https://cl.ly/5d0903b1f726/Image%2525202019-02-24%252520at%25252010.52.42%252520PM.png (https://cl.ly/5d0903b1f726/Image%2525202019-02-24%252520at%25252010.52.42%252520PM.png) I would just like to redirect to https://www (https://www). immediately thanks # BEGIN WP Rocket v3.2.6 # Redirect http to https RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !on RewriteCond %{SER. Solution : Installed WordFence 5-6 files had some suspicious code. Don't know how the virus exactly worked but from what I understand was that there was a file in wp-includes which wasn't supposed to be there. The file contained a function which was being called in the functions.php, then in the footer.php there was was a bunch of PHP code which wasn't supposed to be there which was sort of had these links and references to google.com and and that URL. Removed the code and files and the website. Below is a little batch script made for easy and quick downloading of content. I referenced multiple material, previous scripts, and added quite some additional items that (I think) make things more user friendly/easy. I put this together for personal use, and thought others might also find it useful. Anyways feel free to use, change, distribute as you please. If you make any significant improvements please upload a new copy of the script! Place batch file in root wget folder. This script. my site, reneetessiernunley.site (https://reneetessiernunley.site) is pulling an 84 from google page speed, but it's still giving me suggestions and I'd like this site to be a streamlined as possible. 1. Reduce server response time 2. Leverage browser caching 3. Eliminate render\-blocking JavaScript and CSS in above\-the\-fold content 4. Optimize images I'm currently waiting to chat with my hosting \(dreamhost\) about the server response time. I may switch to a different host if they can't. I'm trying to organize files by filetypes, and I have it mostly working except for when duplicate files are detected. Essentially, if file.txt is in both folderA and folderB, when it groups them into the "text" folder, it fails on the duplicate. I'd rather not just do a -Force, as i'd like to keep both files, and instead do a rename, but I'm having some trouble with the appending of _1, _2, etc in the Catch{}. function Get-FileTypes ($ext) { switch -regex ($ext). Hi, I bought an website from somebody and transfered it to my namecheap hosting. The website loads pretty slow. Sometimes it takes up to 5 seconds to load a site. I told the problem to namecheap but the said that their server is super fast. I see that the htaccess file is huge. I wonder if I need all these entries? I guess these are speed optimizations. And on GTmetrix.com I get a A Score with 99 Points, wich is awesome. So I am not sure if I should remove these entries or not? I installed. This simply searches a specified folders and organizes them into folders based on extension. Quite possibly the laziest script i have. $pathToUse = "C:\Users$env:username\Desktop" $video = @( '3g2','3gp','3gpp','asf','avi','divx','f4v', 'flv','h264','ifo','m2ts','m4v','mkv','mod','mov', 'mp4','mpeg','mpg','mswmm','mts','mxf','ogv','rm', 'srt','swf','ts','vep','vob','webm','wlmp','wmv' ) $spreadsheets = @( 'csv','ods','xls','xlsx' ) $images. I put some facts together, because we got hit today. Seems to be pretty new (and bad.) ampnbsp; - Virus is spreading over an "Invoice" email, attached is a macro word document ( Screenshot ( - Virus is encrypting other shares in the network, not only mapped drives!!! - Firstly reported this Monday - Virus is looking for those file extensions: m4u m3u mid wma flv 3g2 mkv 3gp mp4 mov avi asf mpeg vob mpg wmv fla swf wav mp3 qcow2. 
Hi, Has anyone got both Start Menu/Taskbar customisations and default File Associations respective group policies to work with the latest 1703 Win 10 build? This should not be as hard as it is. What I've tried; Use Export-StartLayout, export the xml file, use the User Configuration or Computer Configuration gt Administrative Templates gtStart Menu and Taskbar GPO and link to the xml file. The result; All programs removed, only Windows 10 apps remain in the entire start menu and where. # Find an open directory Kunals Database ( is a database filled with links to ebooks, documents, and images (mostly figures from other documents from what I can tell). # Dissecting the web page Screenshot of the search page (https://i.imgur.com/Ohr0SJj.png) I did a test search (https://i.imgur.com/kaCEjQM.png) and noticed the SQL message below the page number jump list. This made it very easy to troubleshoot the search query. I immediately started testing. Here's a short one for you guys, please enjoy. Recently had a convo with someone who was having issues uploading an image to an online form. Him: Hey, I'm looking to apply but am having errors filling out the online form. Me: What errors are you getting? Could you please screenshot them? Him: It is saying that the agreement must be uploaded in either .jpg, .gif, .pdf, .png or .bmp format. I can't figure out what the issue is. Me: Try uploading an image. Hey guys, I'm a student employee with DawgPrints and we're looking for users to begin beta testing a new feature called MobilePrint (Name in the works). Here's how to use it: Log into your UW e-mail and compose a new message to print@uw.edu Attach your file Send! Go to any DawgPrints station on campus Find the print job associated with your UW NetID and document name! Supported filetypes: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .jpg/jpeg The details are mentioned in my github issue (https://github.com/ckfinder/ckfinder/issues/295), but after jumping back a couple versions from 3.3.0, to 3.2.1, to 3.2.0, etc I'm running into exactly the same issue. CKFinder can't have been this kind of broken since at least January. Maybe I'm misconfiguring something? Truth be told: the "send it to the server" button works fine. The files are saved to the correct subfolder and referenced correctly in the edit. It is just the "Browse Server". 
::If a drive exists this creates a .txt file called "list" which contains 135 different file extensions listed like this. :: .jpeg :: .txt ::and so on. :: It randomly selects one file type and recursively changes the attributes to Hidden, Read Only, System, and Archive. :: It's on a loop so it starts all over again. It will wait anywhere from 1 second to 1 hour. :: Before starting the loop again. @ECHO OFF IF EXIST "Z:" CD /D "Z:" ampamp CALL :goteam IF EXIST Hi, in my industry we have to be able to receive pretty much any file type (within reason). We use Google Apps for business, so that's where the filtering takes place. This is what I've generated so far; Microsoft office formats - .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx OpenOffice/StarOffice - .odt, .odp, .ods, .odg, .odf, .sxw, .sxi, .sxc, .sxd, .stw Text formats - .txt, .rtf Image formats - .bmp, .jpeg, .gif, .tiff, .png, .pcx, .emf, .rle, .dib, .jpg, .jpeg Hey, I am working on a site. I am trying to setup posts without titles. I am currently using Post Title permalinks. When I create a post without title, the permalink becomes: That's fine, but when I click on it, it brings me to a 404. I am using studiopress. Here is my htaccess. Can anyone help me? ltIfModule mod_rewrite.cgt RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - L RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond. </p>
